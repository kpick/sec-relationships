sec-relationships
=================

A neo4j proof of concept for various types of security relationships.

This is definitely a work in progress. I'm essentially developing a model that will find interesting ways to do security
analysis on a multitude of data feeds from disparate sources, leveraging the relationship between those sources. I'm hacking
together some social networking code right now, to vet out user relationships, and then going to incorpoate other sources
(machines, business domain, vulnerabilities, type of information, etc).
